# Thanks for being interested in contributing! We're so glad you want to help!

Below you'll find guides on the `react-next-boilerplate` community, code of conduct, and how to get started with contributing:

We really like React and some things that we think is excellent is its community, so I would like to use some [Gatsby Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/code-of-conduct/).

## Our standards

Creating a positive environment implies:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful towards differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this code of conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## How to contribute

Feel free to contribute whatever you want by creating issues to improve the source code, contributing ideas to create a better community.

### Opening PRs in react-next-boilerplate

To test reaction-native-polyline-address changes and project files locally,
you can fork the repository and install parts to run it on your local machine

- Follow some of the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/).
- Fork and clone the react-next-boilerplate [repo](https://github.com/react-next-boilerplate/react-next-boilerplate).
- Install yarn to pull in dependencies and build the project.
- Create a branch in Git to isolate your changes:

  ```shell
  git checkout -b some-change
  ```

- Once you have changes in Git that you want to push, add them and create a commit.
- Committing code will run the automated linter using Prettier. To run the linter manually, run an npm script in the project’s base directory:
- Push your changes to your fork, assuming it is set up as origin.
- Create an extraction request to the repository of [react-next-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-next-boilerplate/react-next-boilerplate).
- The development branch is `canary` (this is the branch pull requests should be made against). On a release, the relevant parts of the changes in the `canary` branch are rebased into `master`.
- Please assign the issues you are closing if this is the case, it would be good to place the correct lips.
